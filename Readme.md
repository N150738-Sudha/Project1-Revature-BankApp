In this project, I have designed a web based bank app that simulates banking operations using JDBC, java and SQL, hibernate, CSS, html and javascript. There are two users who can use this app, customers and employees A customer can login to his account or can create a new account. After login, he can view his balance, deposit amount into his account, withdraw money from his account and also he can transfer money to other customer account. An Employee also can create a new account and thereafter he can login into his account. An employee can view customer details by using customer id or customer name and also he can accept or decline a customer account.
